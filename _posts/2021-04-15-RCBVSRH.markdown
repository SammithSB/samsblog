Chennai has been one the weirdest pitches like ever and it got even weird this time. Very few people have been able to consistently hit the ball at death overs which include ABD, Dinesh Karthik and today Glenn Maxwell!!! In 2nd innings, make that only ABD. Funniest thing is there was a report that said Chennai pitches will be suited for high scores this season.

Lets get to the toss, evidence suggests that Kohli loses 60% of tosses, which way lower than we portray it to be, but still 60 is a high number, so when SRH won the toss it wasn't a surprise for even Kohli.
If we had to look at past games for evidence I would say that, you are way better batting 1st over 2nd, pitch gets way too way too quickly, as we saw how MI had kept a test match field yesterday to Russel!! Russel of all people.

One thing about Kohli is, he is very secretive about a lot of stuff which is none of my business by the way but at the same, sometimes he is way too open, gives away IPL strategies even before starts, release team sheets a day before match, when presenter asks who is playing, not only tell him Devdutt is playing, also tell off who is batting at number 3. Warner talked about how he has brought in Nadeem to attack a right hander heavy RCB top order, so to my eyes Kohli was being like, "oh you think you got it right, wait till you see my move son!!" completely throwing off SRH strategy.

It is extremely important as a team to have a strong aggressive start at the Chepauk, because it doesn't seem like anybody will ever make runs at death(well someone will eventually figure it out), which is why when Paddikal got out on 5th ball of 3rd with score of 19 I was bit worried if they would try to be aggressive or try to save wickets, but luckily as Shahbaz Ahmed was sent they could peacefully afford to keep attacking and that is what they kind of did, the over of Holder was next which only went for 6 runs, but the next 2 after that returned 21 runs.

About those two overs, 5th were bowled by Shahbaz Nadeem, so we witnessed a Shahbaz v Shahbaz battle after all. Nadeem tried to bowl a Krunal Pandya like yorker at his legs but missed the line, which meant Ahmed scooped one for a six. In the RCB V MI game, one of the announcer called Shahbaz Ahmed as Nadeem, so what I am think is when that guy saw these two play, he must've thought why is same guy batting as well as bowling.

By the end of end of powerplay i.e the 6th over, RCB were 47/1, not the perfect start, not a bad start, just your average slightyly above average powerplay.

7th over was kind of match turning, its funny because the bowler was also a turner(Ashton Turner approves this joke). Shahbaz Ahmed tried to take on Nadeem immediately but fell short as he was caught out and only 1 run came of that over!!!

Now at this point Star Sports select dugout is talking about Maxwell and will he be successful this IPL, Scott Styris talked about how he has adjusted his technique such that when he gets a chance to play a lofted cover drive, he does not carve the ball, instead comes into proper position and drives it properly.
<br>

**just a select dugout appreciation that is all**

Warner brought Rashid Khan for the 8th over and it was going to be brilliant as Maxwell was also there, if you think about it, the perfect moment here would be Maxwell showing off his technique change to smash Rashid for a boundary and that's what exactly happened. Only 7 runs came of the over, but its Rashid, take any boundary you get.
<br>
The next 2 overs were not really the most productive with only 3 and 5 runs coming of Nadeem and Rashid. The whole of last season RCB had one big issue which was they slowed down a lot in after powerplay and it was worrying to see what was happening here.
<br>
But we had Maxwell ma! Took the game on on the 11th over bowled by Nadeem, pull over midwicket for a six, lofter cover drive for four, pull over midwicket for six again, 16 runs in no time. Total of 22 runs came of that over, suddenly RCB run rate went from 6.3 to 7.72. It was superb hitting.
<br>

But the joy was only temporary because SRH completely choked us for the next 6 overs. Holder got the wicket of Kohli first ball of 12th. He was brilliant, did not give any chance to score runs at all and only gave away 1 run. This was the second time this game an over going for only one run as well as losing a wicket on the first ball of over.
<br>

Rashid was brought back for 14th over and he got the wicket of ABD, it was looking awful for us, went from strong position to weak to a solid one to a really bad one.
RCB were 103/4 at the end of 15th over, not the strongest position to be in, one luckily RCB has an immense batting depth.
Rashid bowled the 16th over and got wicket of Sundar who got out trying to play a no look six. That over also went for only 3 runs and if that was not enough, next over natarajan took wicket of Christian(my x-factor) and only gave 4 runs.
<br>

But the most important thing still was that Maxwell was still not out, he was still there. Jamieson and Maxwell together nailed Bhuvaneshwar in the 17th over, scoring 3 4s and a total of 14 runs.
19th over was by Nattu and 12 runs came off of it, it was looking really good for RCB. Maxwell played one of Maxwellest shots on a yorker, he tried to bowl a wide yorker but it became a sort of wide one, Maxwell almost sat, switch his bat and scooped one over for a four. Even on the last ball, Maxwell did not care, instead of what most people would do take a single, he attacked. Jamieson in the final over tried to slog but got caught, but the important thing was Maxwell was brought back on strike.
Maxwell was fixed that he was not going to run if there wasn't a 2, for some reason Holder was not trying to do the wide yorker plan which all the teams love so much. He learnt he had to bowl wider deliveries after Maxwell crunched one for a massive, massive six. He did get out trying to reach a wide one, but scored around 13 runs of the last over which in that pitch was golden.
<br>

**Now the game won on!! 150 was not enough but it definitely was to give a challenge**

SRH innings started, RCB gave the first over to Siraj and boy he bowled well, like really really well, nipping, swinging, Saha was clueless, unlucky that the last ball was a leg byes for four, but anyway he got a maiden over. Siraj got rewards for his bowling in the second over taking wicket of Saha but the thing was he was never the main threat, two guys in this SRH team have ability to crush us and were still not out with batting were Warner and Bairstow and Warner was looking in supreme touch too, batting ultra aggresively, SRH went to 50/1 at the end of powerplay and Warner was batting at a strike rate of over 200!! Some guy on twitter tweeted that only Warner can bat on Sharjah like its Chennai and bat like its Chennai in Sharjah which was just too good.

<br>

One thing which still bothers me is not using Sundar in powerplay, maybe Kohli is trying to groom his as a middle over specialist for Indian team, but we have Chahal for that ma, he is brilliant there, use Sundar where he is really really good in powerplay, if you want to groom him you can anyway give one over to him there. RCB did not really have the best of powerplays to justify not bowling Sundar.
<br>
RCB took the required run rate which was at 7.14 at the end of powerplay to all the way up to 7.71, you might think arey 7.71 is manageable, no ma it is not, required run rate had claimed to almost what it was required before SRH innings started which is terrible given that death overs were about to start where nobody had scored any runs.(Now saying death over was about to start is just a fancy way of saying as we reach end pitch becomes difficult to bat that's all)
<br>

**Don't leave everything to the end of innings, very difficult to score at death.**

What would be the most terrible thing to happen here? You guessed it right Warner getting out, and he did. Kyle Jamieson did not have the best first two overs but he more than made up for it in his 3rd over. He only gave 6 runs in the over including leg byes. The only threat really was Jonny Bairstow, if RCB somehow got his wicket game was over, it was not going to be easy for him though, it was a really difficult pitch to bat on. The next 2 overs of Ahmed and Chahal went for only 13 runs which was superb for RCB.
SRH needed 35 of 24 balls and the biggest twist happened here. Virat brought in Shahbaz Ahmed, slow left armers have been proven to be very effective here, Krunal yesterday, Nadeem today apart from that carnage over where Maxwell went berserk, so it was kind of a nice move by Kohli and it paid of brilliantly because he got 2 in 2, the first two balls of the over were wickets, that too big ones, Bairstow and Pandey, he did not stop there, he got another wicket in the final ball of the over, giving away only one run and taking 3 big big wickets!! Now the equation being 34 of 18 ball.

Harshal Patel whose role for has been the death over specialist has paid off really well with him controlling really well, giving away only 7 runs and even taking wicket of Vijay Shankar.
Now for the 19th over Virat had 2 choices either go with Ahmed or Siraj, now both were risky ones, sla have been effective but if you are good enough spin hitter you can be taken down shown by Maxwell, Siraj is because he has not been the best bowler at death and we have seen Rashid Khan do crazy stuff to bowlers even to established death bowlers but it was a bold move and he we #playbold. Rashid hit a six of the first ball itself and "yella bayig bandbidtu", but then he got the wicket of Holder 2 balls later and they scored 11 runs of the over. Full excitement and thrills, there was no way RCB could lose that game but there has been long history of that happening, so nothing was certain, oh! what a rush.

<br>
Now with Harshal Patel bowling last over, it was a hopeful that he would pull it off, but on the 3rd ball, his hands slipped and a full toss no ball, oh hell!!! after doing so much so well, this happens, IPL man, not for the light hearted, but luckily he pulled it off, free hit was a dot ball, it was really good change of pace which made him miss it, Rashid got out the immediate ball after that and all was well and good after that, game was done and dusted with even Nadeem getting out on the 5th ball.
<br>

**After that no ball**

Main takeaways and fun stuff:
Shahbaz Nadeem and Shahbaz Ahmed when facing each other is always fun.
Manish Pandey really needs to sort out his issues here, he is so good and aggressive in SMAT, SRH need to get best out of him, he has won an IPL final man, was the first Indian to score IPL hundred, I don't think we need to doubt his abilities, his recent form and the way he is going through his role at SRH, yes that's not how he should, but do not want such an incredible talent to go waste.

Maxwell has found his perfect match, Maxwell is a guy who is a guy who is perfectly suited to destroy bowling lineups, you cannot expect him to give you 600-700 run seasons every year, he is not that kind of player, but what he can give you 400-450 run seasons at 155 strike rate and do not underestimate those players, those are the guys who win you games from impossible situations. I mean there is always a chance he will go on to make 650 runs at 150 SR but that is not something you can expect consistently.
RCB is one of the team for whom that kind of an overseas player is gold and they are in my opinion bringing the best out of him.
Harshal is turning out to be the go to man this season
Rashid is a legend, he will definitely be the all time great t20 spinner.
