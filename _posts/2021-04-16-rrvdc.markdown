Samson and Pant are the latest to addition to the captains in this league, leading for the first time in this league, so it was always going to be fun looking at how they do. Sanju Samson used to play for Delhi Daredevils(now Capitals) and once Sanju and Pant got together to chase down 209 runs against Gujrat Lions!!!
<br>

**Sanju and Pant back then**

<br>

Now during toss referee was way too quick to take away the coin the moment he told who won, most probably because Sanju tried to take it away last time.
<br>

**Refree must have been like**

Now when I found out that Jaydev Unadkat was going to play in Wankhede, I did not know what to think about that, paapa of all the places you could play, he was being made to play in Wankhede, where players were being smacked for fun, well he did make me bite my own words, I am not worried about that, if it were up to me, everyone would play, I know that would make the game boring, but for sure would make me happy, if someone proves me wrong, I actually love it, allows to improve your decision making.
<br>

**As long as game is fun I am happy**

But Delhi made horrendous team selection, I do not think anybody would argue with that.
First they dropped Hetmyer, which can only be justified if you are playing maybe a Sam Billings or something, not if you are playing Rahane and Tom Curran. Now I am not saying Tom Curran is a bad player, he has done well in Australia and England, but he has not done the same in India or UAE, like ever. Lot of people even questioned playing Rahane, but he had bowled really well last time, so I was expecting to do well here too, it was an okay decision to keep Woakes.
<br>

**Ponting when Pant told his plan to play Hetty at number 3**
<br>

<br>

Now when everyone was expecting a big 200 score and only 2 runs came of the first over, it was kind of worrying, but it was fine because they would smash it in the end, well it got even worse, the second over was bowled by Unadkat and he bowled really really well, he changed up the pace last ball of the over which Shaw did not read, tried to play across nicked and got caught at backward point. Now this freaked out half of internet, I could smell it, it was going to be a really good game.
<br>

<br>

Delhi attacked a little, scoring 11 runs in the third over, but the first ball of 4th over, Dhawan tried to scoop one and Sanju caught it!!!! That probably was the catch of the game, almost a "Dinesh Karthik:, yes I call it that. Now the second ball to Pant was even more incredible, almost caught an edge off of Pant, extremely good bowling.

At end of 4th over RR are 20/2, worst position ever, there was a stat that Delhi and Rajasthan have lost most wickets in powerplay since last season IPL. 5th over went for 11 runs, what do I talk about it, nothing speacial happened there. 31/2 at this stage.
Now its the 6th over of powerplay and they have gone back with Unadkat, for his third straight over and guess what he did, got wicket of Rahane, he was supposed to save Delhi from these situations, which is one of the main reasons people want players like Rahane to be in team, to save team from collapse, what to do when they are the ones who are part of the collapse, Rahane has failed to save Delhi from a collapse, multiple times now, which is really sad to see, given how much I love the him and the team, but I love RR more, so I did not mind it this time.
<br>

**When Rahane got out and realising he probably won't be played from now after this**

<br>

Rajasthan have 3 left arm bowlers this game, the third one being Mustafizur, he was brought for the 7th over. Now he is also a Unadkat type bowler, who relies a lot on those slower ones. He did bowl brilliantly, he rattled Stoinis with 3 dot balls. Now if I am a batsman who has faced 3 dot balls, I am not only under immense pressure, I am going through hell right there, 3 balls is like 2.5% of the innings without scoring nothing continuously is a crime I would never want to commit, that is the perfect opportunity for a bowler to attack the guy with whichever your weapon is. It was full length which Stoinis tried to kind of defend but right went up? I don't know how it went up, but it did, Buttler caught a brilliant catch.
<br>

**Mustafizur has had a way better season start than expected from him**
<br>

<br>

8th over was bowled by Morris and went for 9 runs, the most important bowler of the group was leaking runs, maybe an indication that slow change of pace deliveries were working better than higher pace ones.
Delhi are at 46/4 by the way, worst possible position to be in.
<br>

Parag bowled the 9th, he is one of those guys who will do anything to survive, he is the proper definition of survival of the fittest along side Krunal Pandya, do everything you can to do make sure runs are not scored. So obviously Parag had to bring out the "Jadhav ball", yes I call it that, I am not good at names.
<br>

**I will show this every time he bowls, if he does it everytime also I do not care, its amazing and you have to see it**
<br>

Now at this point, only established batsman in Pant, Lalit yadav is good player but has never played in IPL, so having high expectations on his is not advisable, Woakes and Tom Curran have batting skills but the same, cannot expect stuff from them, if they play well then well and good.
With 11 overs remaining, Pant has to play an innings like what "Rahane would", also he needs to aggressive because "he is an aggressive batsman, what is the point of having one if he doesn't", he cannot get out hitting sixes because he will be called "irresponsible for doing that".
Well he kind of delivered, when nobody was able to score a single run, he chose his opponents wisely and smacked Tewatia all over the place, brought up a 30 ball 50!!
He was so good, his innings ended because of a fielding brilliance by Parag, if not for that direct hit I wonder what else Pant would have done, but we need to stop living in hindsight, lets get to the present here. DC were 89/5 here

After this DC innings lost track a little, were not able to score runs at all. By the end of 15th over even Lalit Yadav got out leaving Delhi at 102/6.
Now what was the par score for them? You could expect at least 30 more, I would probably would have said 40 more, because Curran, Woakes and Ashwin are capable batsman.
I was very close to getting it right as Delhi got to a 147.
It was mostly simply whacking and mad running in last 3 overs which got them there.
They also played some really nice shots, not denying that.

If you think about it Samson was brilliant as a captain out there, made perfect use of Unadkat, the weak point for Unadkat has always been his death bowling, not saying he was good at other stages, he struggled there also, but we had seen him bowling some really good spells at start and give it away at death.
When asked at what stage do you think you will win the game he was like "I would love to win it by the end of 10th over but I am not a batsman", what a guy!!

Now if you thought it was going to be a simple chase you were far far far away from being right. Woakes and Avesh were bowling perfect length almost rattling the batsmen.
Only 5 runs came off the first two overs.
The third over was a big one and the architect was:
<br>
![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BpNEwiv.jpg)

The first two balls were smacked by Manan Vohra for fours, it was looking like RR were about start the attack, but nope!! Vohra couldn't connect it properly and it went to hands of Rabada.
Worst possible thing that could happen happened just 2 balls later with Chris Woakes banging one in swinger at length, took off the edge of Buttler and dead.
If you thought misery was over, it was only going to get worse, Rabada was brought in for the 3rd over he got the wicket of Samson on the 3rd ball itself. Worse was getting "worser"(I make up words too).
<br>

**RR fans were like**

Now let me talk about the guy about whom I did not talk at all till now, who is David Miller. He was the go to guy for Kings 11 Punjab(now Punjab kings) for three years from 2013-15, after which he could never replicate it in later years.
<br>

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/0uO6bwE.jpg?1)
<br>

He was coming off a really good form in ODI where his skills have never been doubted. He also recently brought a game alive for South Africa out of nowhere in a t20 game in Pakistan too. RR ended their powerplay with score 26/3 which is just absolutely terrible. When a team takes 3 wickets in powerplay more often than not, that team wins, but what to do when both teams lost 3 wickets.
<br>

<br>

Now it was time for AshWin, Ash anna is one of those guys to whom, slight sniff of a victory is enough to choke you down. He absolutely strangled them giving away just 14 runs in his 3 overs. We also saw 2 wickets fall in the overs between his.
Tom Curran was brought in for the 12th over and even he gave just 2 runs. 58/5 at the end of 12 overs. Required run rate shot up to 11, 2 left handers, there was no reason why Ashwin should not have been bowled. But Pant decided to bowl Stoinis, maybe to get over with one Stoinis over, but it wasn't really needed, what was needed was getting done with the game as soon as possible, as we have seen anything can happen at death.
Stoinis came and Miller was extremely happy, scored 3 consecutive 4s. 15 runs came of that over, rrr came down to 10.7, it was not looking bad, somehow.
<br>

**Pant to Stoinis**

<br>

The next Tom Curran over game away 12 runs, rrr down to 10.5, were Rajasthan going to make a comeback? They were on their way to but Rabada is one big problem, man came and took the wicket of Rahul Tewatia. Now the target was 58 from 30 balls, not impossible, but not easy also, the thing in favor was that Rabada had only one over.
Now Miller looked at Avesh Khan, it was the perfect opportunity for him to take the game on, shifting it towards the end and he did, he smacked 2 consecutive sixes. We do not know if Tom Curran how good or bad Tom Curran will be, we don't know if Woakes will give any easy balls, it was the perfect opportunity for Miller to get as far ahead as possible, he tried to hit one more six, but he didn't time it well, he got out, he was heavily criticised by commentators for going for another six, but that is wrong mindset, if he had got out trying for 2nd six they probably would have been like he doesn't have ability only to finish off games, **PLEASE CHANGE YOUR MINDSET PA, THAT WAS THE OVER AND CHANCE RR HAD TO GO FAR FAR AHEAD OF DELHI**.
<br>

<br>

In 17th over we saw Unadkat hit a six to Woakes, after he had just said he was not a batsman this happens, brilliant!!!
Tom Curran was brilliant, actually Unadkat was almost run out on the first ball of 18th over, because he slipped while going back but lucky for him even Pant dropped the ball while running him out. Only 7 runs came of that over.
<br>
The slow ball craze was so much that in the 19th over even Rabada tried to bowl, which he should not have because Morris a very big bully, anything to near as easy ball will always go out of the ground and that is what happened. He smoked another six on the 5th ball of over, right out of the middle of the bat by the way. 15 runs came of the over, game completely turned around, Morris even had the strike in the last over.
They still could have gone with Ashwin, RR needed 12 and Morris has had his fair share of struggles against spin bowling, but they persisted with Tom Curran and the poor guy was thrashed by Morris, he tried a slower one(WHY IS EVERYONE TRYING ONE, IT JUST DOES NOT WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE). 4th ball was a yorker gone wrong which he nailed it to perfection for a six and he did it for them!!!!
<br>

**to those who bowl slower balls like their main delivery and less like a variation**

36 off 18, 16.25Cr absolutely worth it.
When teams are ready to pay you that much amount of big money, the expectations are to win you at least 3-4 games or 1-2 games like these, not everyone can do that and if you do, you will be paid the big bucks for sure.
<br>
Now I know, a lot of you will be like Sanju should have taken a single, dude do you know what Morris himself said? He said he wanted to take a double, even he knew obviously Sanju should have been on strike, what he did not realise was there was no way Sanju could have run back a 2nd run.
<br>

**Things sometimes work out, sometimes don't, stop living in hindsight**

<br>

Main takeaways and fun stuff:
Sanju has some next level confidence on his team as well as his players, when asked why he chose bowling, he was like because I have faith in bowlers, "I don't mind them going for runs, we will come and hit them."
At the end when Sanju was asked if he thinks about games and if he would have run that single he said, "yes, I always think about the game and even if I played that game 100 times I would not have run that single", extreme clarity in his thought process.
Pant has evolved to a next level beast now.
I don't know if I love Parag more of his dance more.
Rajasthan are enjoying their game a lot and I love it.
RR can probably think of opening with Miller.
Anything happens anyday, happiness somehow reaches Morgan, this time is Chris Woakes.
Even Ponting did agreed that Ashiwn should have been bowled for teh foutth over, but its fine, they will hopefully learn from their mistakes, anyway with that team selection they should not have won, that would've eencouraged doing such nonsense now and again.
