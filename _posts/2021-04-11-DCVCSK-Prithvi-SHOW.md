Wankhede is one of the most incredible cricket pitches to bat on, so when Pant decided to choose to field after winning the toss, it came as surprise to nobody.
Now if we talk about teams, with the number of options CSK had there were too many combinations of teams to keep track of, but the one they chose to field was a typical Dhoni 11, choosing players on whom Dhoni has obssesive level of faith in. This game was also the return of Mr. IPL, Suresh Raina which is always nice to see.




With no Rabada or Nortje, this was a relatively way weaker Delhi side than we are going to see in the future games, but in no way shape or form they were a weak side, immense batting depth, power hitters, dashing openers as well as experienced spinners, this is what forms the best 11 of few of the teams, shows how strong a squad they have.

One of the biggest uncertainities for DC this game was how would Chris Woakes bowl for them, because, he rarely plays the t20 format for England these days and he did not play a single game for England this winter, after bowling his first ball, he had bowled more balls for DC than for England this year. He was getting beautiful swing out there.

In fact the first 6 overs of the innings were extremely eventful, with lots and lots of stuff happening. The first over started with Woakes beating the outside edge of Gaikwad and in reply him with as sweet a drive you can imagine. Only 5 runs of the over.
Faf Du Plesis was the highest run scorer for CSK last season, how he plays was always going to be crucial for them, but unfortunately as soon as Gaikwad gave strike to Faf in the second over, Avesh Khan got the better of him, ball was a much fuller, close to 140Ks delivery and it was almost a plumb in front.

To sprinkle salt on those wounds, Gaikwad got out the first ball of the third over, Woakes made proper use of the swing he was getting, bowling proper test match lengths, he was rewarded for that. Last season memories started floating back, but this time they have Raina and Moeen, way better middle order batsmen than they had last time around. It showed too, with Moeen and Raina counterattacking Avesh Khan and Ashwin even though Ashwin was not the matchup which was in favour of them, extracting 19 runs of the 2 overs. They were at 30/2 at the end of 5 overs. Final over was bowled by Tom Curran, the man has the worst economy rate for any bowler in IPL, which is insane, but he was superb in the over giving away just 3 runs. CSK were strangled at 33/2 by the end of powerplay. Not looking good for CSK, but one nice thing was, Raina and Moeen had shown as long as they are there, Ashwin was not going to be a threat for them.

Even though they had a bad start, CSK were extremely productive in the middle overs, the portion of the game which costed them most of the matches last season. They scored 103 in between 7th and the 15th over which is unreal!!!
Ashwin was torn apart by Moeen and Raina, with 9th over going for 18 runs, yes he got the wicket of Moeen which was extremely crucial at that stage, but still it was a below average performance and it happens and I am sure he will do way better things for DC than this. Amit Mishra had bowled his first two overs relatively well going for only 10 runs, but Raina was in no mood to stop, he scored 14 runs of the first 3 balls of the 12th over of the innings. Things were looking pretty well for CSK and it got even better when Stoinis came in, one of the balls slipped and came over waist length of Rayadu but it was also dispatched for a six by Rayadu, the free hit was a leg bye which went for four. The last ball was pulled away for a six by Raina which brought his 50!!!

Among all these explosive overs, Tom Curran managed to get wicket of Rayadu and also had given just 7 runs in the 14th over of the match, he was having a really good game till then. The next over by Stoinis went for 12 runs, which ended one of the most insane middle over hitting by a team, given it was done by CSK is even more special.


Given how good they were in the middle over, it would be a nice assumption that they would do well in the death, at least that's what we thought. A terrible mix up meant that Raina got run out, he looked so good out there, that probably was only thing that could've stopped that man. Biggest talking point of all was that Dhoni had not come in to bat till that point, everyone wanted him at number 4 which did not happen, he sent Rayadu at 5, number 6? Nope Jaddu, which wasn't even a tactical move with Raina a lefty already there. He came in at number 7, had a brief stay and he got bowled 2nd ball of his innings. Everything was looking really well for DC, with overs 16-18 going for a combined total of just 19 runs.
But it wasn't all over for CSK, Sam Curran took his elder brother Tom Curran for absolute cleaners. Well Tom had a brilliant day till that over, but a missed full length delivery which was sent went for a six over long on, bouncer directed outside off was smacked for another six, and to top it all off a 4 through covers meant Tom Curran figures went form 3-0-17-1 to 4-0-40-1. Insane how one over can turn around and make everything you did before null and void.

Chris Woakes did a relatively good death bowling than what was expected of him, good running between wickets meant they would score 10 runs of the over, had a happy ending for Woakes though, getting the wicket of Sam Curran.
CSK ended up at 188/7 which was kind of below after looking at CSK's middle order batting itself, but way way better than they where at then end of powerplay.


Now when the DC innings everyone, it was going to be very very interesting, Prithvi Shaw was coming in after a HULK level domestic season where he flexed how good a player he is, he probably also worked and adjusted the error in his style that was causing him to get out even before he got in at IPL and the international level. But it was not going to be easy given the history of Chahar and Shaw, Shaw had scored 38 runs of 39 balls and had got out 5 times to Chahar before this encounter. But he looked way more comfortable than he ever did. Interesting thing was that last season before the start of a horrid run for Shaw he had scored 66(41) which ensured a win for DC. 
There wasn't really much to talk about powerplay here, it was just Shaw manhandling CSK bowlers, he smoked the "LORD" Thakur for 3 consecutive boundaries in the 5th over, which was heavily profitable over for DC as 17 runs came off of it.
One other interesting as well as super cool thing was, last season when Shikhar Dhawan scored his first IPL 100 which was against CSK, he had scored one six, that too to Sam Curran it was just him extending his hands and hitting straight above bowlers head, in the 3rd over, he smashed a six which looked very very similar, only difference was Dhawan had his legs wide apart last season.

CSK still have still not got a breakthrough by the way, DC were just on cruise mode, scoring at least a boundary every over.
The thing which was most interesting was that Dwayne Bravo was not brought in till the 14th over, which was extremely interesting, now this strategy works well when you have got wickets in the start, DJ Bravo is one of the champions of t20 cricket, extreme utility player, specialises at death but can bowl anywhere, you would assume Dhoni would have brought him in before but he didn't. 
3rd ball of his first over, he took the wicket of ever dangerous Shaw, who was looking well set for an incredible 100. That over just went for 3 runs and a wicket, just for some more perspective than necessary about how good that over was for CSK, DC had scored 15 runs of the previous over and of the previous 5 overs DC had scored 51 runs.
But it was kind of little too late, runs flow did not stop at all.
Even though Shardul Thakur(LORD) got the wicket of Dhawan on 3rd ball of 17th over, he already had leaked 9 runs of the first 2 deliveries and required run rate was almost 6. It was only a matter of time DC would win.

**Main takeaways:**
Prithvi Shaw and his show stopping batting, hope he continues to do that.
Dhawan the run machine is still going strong, he keeps getting better and better every year, amazing to watch.
Chris Woakes has shown he has the t20 game in him and if need be he can be a replacement for South Africans without affecting the bowling by a lot.
Tom Curran's death bowling is still under a lot of questioning, he was brilliant the fist three overs, but all went down in the last one, death bowling which was the reason he got selected to the England teams has become his weaker point.
Sam Curran has shown he can bat superbly well at the back end of the innings, which is a great sign for CSK as well as England, bowling still questionable, but hey! one problem at a time.
Delhi Capitals were superbly lucky Avesh Khan and Chris Woakes were that economical, we do not know if they can sustain it, but if they do, its looking all well and good for Delhi.
